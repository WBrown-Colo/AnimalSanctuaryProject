## Lessons Learned

One of the biggest take aways from this project is utilizing UML diagrams. I have been struggling with being able to find a starting point when coding. Following these diagrams helps me invision how all the classes/subclasses should be organized. This also helps me understand what is being called and by what/where. using IS-A and HAS-A concepts encapsulates these UMLs for me.
